# To test
- Encryption
  - Do others connect EATT channels without encryption?
  - Can data be sent without encryotion?
- Client Supported Features Characteristic
  - Do we need to write to bits here?
  - Do others write to this?
- Server Supported Features Characteristic
  - Do others check this?
  - Do others expect us to check this?
- Collision mitigation
  - Do centrals retry immideately?
  - Do we need some more complex retry mechanism?
    - Exponential backoff?
    - Max retries?
  - Do others autoconnect EATT channels?
- Caching
  - All the cases in the bsim test
